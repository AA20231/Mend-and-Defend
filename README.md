# Mend & Defend
Welcome to my p5.js game (with the p5play library), Mend & Defend! This game was created as part of the GWC SIP 2024 as part of a Game Jam The prompt was "What Hope Means to Me"

This is First Aid themed game, with 2 sections and 6 mini-games, as well as features such as character selection. This game takes the player through a first-aider experience, allowing them to equip their first aid kits through a series of challenges and then use their equipment to fight against the injuries, ranging from minor cuts to CPR!

I hope you enjoy the game, feedback is welcome! :)
